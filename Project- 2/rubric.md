Certainly! Let's break down the instructions for the project titled "Build an OpenAI Chatbot." I'll provide a concise summary for each step:

1. **Data Wrangling**:
   - Load your project dataset into a pandas dataframe.
   - Ensure that the dataframe contains at least 20 rows, with each row having a text sample in a column named "text."

2. **Custom Query Completion**:
   - Successfully send a custom query to the OpenAI model using information from your project dataset.
   - Receive a response from the model.

3. **Demonstrate Custom Prompt Performance**:
   - Create at least two questions that yield different answers when using a custom prompt compared to a basic prompt with the same model.
   - You should have a total of four Q&A pairs: two questions with custom answers and the same two questions with basic answers.

4. **Select a Dataset and Explain Rationale**:
   - Choose a dataset for generating custom prompts.
   - Write at least one sentence explaining why you believe the chosen dataset is appropriate for this chatbot application.

Remember to replace your OpenAI API key with a placeholder ("YOUR API KEY") before submitting your project. Additionally, consider implementing the suggested improvements to make your project stand out!
