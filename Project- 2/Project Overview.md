# Project: Build Your Own Custom Chatbot

In this project, you'll have the exciting opportunity to create your very own custom chatbot! The goal is to select a data source, explain why it's suitable for the task, incorporate it into your chatbot's code, and then evaluate the chatbot's performance.

## What Will You Build?

By the end of this project, you'll have a personalized OpenAI chatbot tailored to a scenario of your choice. Here's what you'll be responsible for:

1. **Data Source Selection**: Choose a data source that aligns with your chatbot's purpose.
2. **Explanation**: Justify why your chosen data source is appropriate for the task.
3. **Integration**: Incorporate the data source into your custom chatbot's code.
4. **Question Writing**: Craft questions that showcase your chatbot's capabilities.

## Data Sources

There are two primary data sources we recommend for this project:

1. **Wikipedia API**: If you've seen the demos and exercises, the Wikipedia API will feel familiar. You can select any Wikipedia article (except for 2022 or the 2023 Syria-Turkey Earthquake) as long as it meets the project requirements.

2. **CSV Data**: We've also provided a data directory containing CSV files that you can use:

   - **2023_fashion_trends.csv**: This file contains reports and quotes about fashion trends for 2023. Each row includes the source URL, article title, and a text snippet.
   - **character_descriptions.csv**: Here, you'll find character descriptions from theater, television, and film productions. Each row includes the character's name, description, medium, and setting. Fun fact: All these characters were invented by an OpenAI model!
   - **nyc_food_scrap_drop_off_sites.csv**: This file provides information about food scrap drop-off sites in New York City, including locations and hours. The data was retrieved in early 2023, and you can also access the latest version from this [open data portal](https://example-link-to-data-portal.com).

Remember, you're not limited to these options. Feel free to source your own dataâ€”perhaps through web scraping or other documents you have on hand. Just ensure that your dataset has at least 20 rows and consists of text data. Keep in mind that OpenAI language models aren't optimized for numeric or logical reasoning, so avoid number-heavy data like budgets or sensor readings.

## Custom Scenario

Beyond the technical aspects of integrating the dataset, you'll need to explain why your chosen data source is suitable for the task. Here's how you'll do it:

1. **Start of the Notebook**: Write a brief paragraph describing your dataset choice and setting up the scenario where this customization would be useful.
2. **End of the Notebook**: Demonstrate the model's Q&A before and after customization to highlight the improvements.

Happy chatbot building! ðŸ¤–ðŸš€
