1. **Choose a Dataset and Explain the Scenario**:
   - You'll need to select a dataset for your chatbot project. Consider the options described on the Project Overview page.
   - In the second cell of your Jupyter Notebook, there's a TODO in a Markdown cell. Edit that cell to explain which dataset you've chosen and why it's suitable for your chatbot scenario.

2. **Prepare the Dataset for the Custom Query Process**:
   - None of the dataset options are in the exact format needed for the custom query process.
   - Your task is to reshape or clean the data so that it can be loaded into a pandas dataframe with a column named "text."
   - Remember, you're not required to use pandasâ€”you can use other software like Excel or Google Sheets if you prefer.

3. **Perform the Custom Query Process**:
   - Integrate your chosen dataset with the custom query code provided in the notebook.
   - Ensure that you're using your custom dataset, not one from the course content.

4. **Write Questions to Demonstrate Custom Performance**:
   - Towards the end of the notebook, you'll find spaces for "Question 1" and "Question 2."
   - Write at least two questions that showcase how the model's answers differ with and without your custom prompt.

Remember to replace your OpenAI API key with a placeholder ("YOUR API KEY") before submitting your project. Good luck, and happy coding! ðŸ¤–ðŸš€

# Submission Instructions

Once you've met all of the rubric requirements, you can submit your project using one of these options:

1. **Workspace Submission**:
   - Click the "SUBMIT PROJECT" button on the workspace page to submit directly from the workspace.

2. **Local Machine Submission**:
   - If you prefer to work on your local computer, follow these steps:
     - Set up Python 3.9 and create an environment containing the dependencies listed in the [requirements.txt](https://example-link-to-requirements.txt) file.
     - Download the necessary project files either directly from the workspace or from the course resources.
     - Before submitting, replace your OpenAI API key with a placeholder (e.g., "YOUR API KEY"). Your reviewer will use their own API key for testing.

Remember to double-check your submission and ensure that your API key is properly masked. Good luck, and happy submitting! ðŸš€
